# Two folders:
 
 1. FIMUS_project (NetBeans project)
 2. SampleData 
 
 FIMUS is developed based on Java programming language (jdk1.8.0_211) using NetBeans IDE (8.0.2). 
 
# How to run:
 
	1. Open project in NetBeans
	2. Run the project

# Sample input and output:
run:
Please enter the name of the file containing the 2 line attribute information.(example: c:\data\attrinfo.txt)

C:\SampleData\attrinfo.txt

Please enter the name of the data file having missing values: (example: c:\data\data.txt)

C:\SampleData\data.txt

Please enter the name of the output file: (example: c:\data\out.txt)

C:\SampleData\output.txt
